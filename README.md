Project Description
Quantum Circuit Simulator/Visualizer: The user can design a quantum circuit by placing quantum gates on qubit lines and visualizing the quantum circuit. The VGA display visually represents the selected quantum circuit layout. Once the circuit is executed, the simulator computes the quantum state and displays the final measurement result of the qubits as well as bloch sphere. The user selects the quantum gate and places it on the qubit using the PS/2 keyboard and audio will be played when the user interacts.
The user can toggle between the initial states of the qubit lines using push buttons.

How to navigate with the project : 
User presses KEY0 to START move to circuit page
User can toggle between the initial states of the qubit line using the push button
User can place a quantum gate on a qubit line by PS/2 keyboard 
For eg. Placing H gate on Qubit line 0 
User press 0 on keyboard -> press H -> press Enter
User can Run the simulation by press R and the final measurements page would appear as well as user can press B to see the Bloch sphere simulation
User can reset by pressing ESC and backspace key.
